FeynArts 3 README file

FeynArts is a Mathematica package for the generation and
visualization of Feynman diagrams and amplitudes.

To install FeynArts, unpack the archive FeynArts3.tar.gz in a
directory. FeynArts requires Mathematica 3 or higher. The topology
editor needs a Java VM and the J/Link package. Both ingredients can
be obtained free of charge from

http://www.wolfram.com/solutions/mathlink/jlink		(J/Link),
http://java.sun.com/j2se				(Java).

Installing a Java VM may not even be necessary, as many systems
(e.g. Windows) have it pre-installed. Follow the instructions
that come with J/Link for installation on the various platforms.

More detailed instructions can be found in the manual, in the file
FA3Guide.ps.gz. The latest version of FeynArts can be downloaded
from http://www.feynarts.de.

Enjoy!
