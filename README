This release of FeynArts includes an X11 (`point-and-click')
topology editor.

The X11 interface is written in C (TopEdit.tm) and must be compiled 
before using. To this end, you need mcc (the MathLink C compiler) 
which should come with your Mathematica distribution.

To compile the topology editor, change to the FeynArts directory and
type
	compile

That's all. IF THIS DOESN'T WORK, PLEASE TELL ME!

The editor is called internally by FeynEdit, so the syntax for editing 
topologies stays the same.

The editor itself is not properly documented yet but fairly easy to use: 
- Click and drag a red square to displace a vertex.
- Click and drag a blue square to move the center of the line 
  (i.e. change its curvature).
- Click on a blue square with the middle or right button to make the
  line straight again.
- Click `Finished' when finished.
- Click `Abort' to exit and discard all changes.
- Click `shift Up' and `shift Down' to shift the whole diagram 
  vertically by +-1/2 a unit.
- Click `Revert' to revert to the initial layout of the topology.
- Click `(un)Snap grid' to switch between moving points freely and
  moving them only to grid points.


Enjoy!
