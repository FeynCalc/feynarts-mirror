FeynArts 2.2 README file

FeynArts is a program for the generation and visualization of Feynman
diagrams and amplitudes.

Some of the features of version 2.2 are:

- Generation of diagrams is possible at three levels, generic fields,
  classes of fields, or specific particles.

- The representation of the kinematical quantities like spinors or vector
  fields can be chosen by the user in a generic model file.

- Generation of counter terms and generic 1PI vertex functions is
  supported.

- Fermion-number violating theories are supported.

- Vertices of arbitrary degree are allowed (needed for effective
  theories).

- Mixing propagators are supported.

- Sophisticated graphics capabilities including output in LaTeX picture
  environment.

Requirements  :

- Mathematica 2.2 or above, 

- for the topology editor: gcc and an X11 platform (including developer's
  tools, i.e. include files, xmkmf, libX*).


Installation notes for the impatient:

- unpack the archive FeynArts22.tar.gz in some directory
  (presumably you did this already or else you wouldn't be reading
  this file)

- run ./compile to compile the C programs needed by FeynArts

For more detailed instructions see the manual in FA22Guide.ps.gz.

The latest version of FeynArts can be downloaded from
http://www.feynarts.de.

Enjoy!

  Notes on the X11 requirement:

Background:
  A topology does not by itself provide information on how to draw it.
  When FeynArts encounters a topology for which is does not yet know the
  shape, it tries to autoshape the topology, and then calls the topology
  editor for the user to refine the shape. Shapes once defined are saved.

Problem:
  The topology editor is a function (called Shape) which before version
  2.2 was written entirely in Mathematica, and whereas Mathematica has
  considerable graphics _output_ capabilities, it has no way except the
  keyboard to obtain _input_ from the user. In other words, the user
  interface of the old Shape function was slow and tedious to use.
  In 2.2 it has been replaced by a nice point-and-click topology editor
  written in C, TopEdit, which uses MathLink to communicate with
  Mathematica. The drawback is that TopEdit relies on the X-Windows
  graphics interface that customarily comes with Unix.

Impact:
  Since the shapes are already defined for many standard topologies, the
  topology editor might never be needed. Even for a new topology, FeynArts
  tries very hard to work out a reasonable shape before sending it to the
  editor. If there is no topology editor, the shapes cannot be refined,
  and that is that. The program does not crash or hang. Generation of
  topologies, diagrams, or amplitudes is not affected in any way.

Solution/Workaround:
  Reformat your hard disk and install Linux, then try again.
  Caution: this process may lose data ;-)

  Seriously: If you feel the topology editor is necessary for your
  application, you should use an old version of FeynArts. For instance,
  the old version 1.2 is a perfectly functional program if you don't need
  the extensions of version 2, like fermion-number violating couplings.
  If you want to try to compile TopEdit anyway: TopEdit itself uses only
  the very basic Xlib calls, and no fancy Motif widgets etc. Apart from
  the Xlib calls, the TopEdit program should be ANSI C and not use any
  specific Unix commands. An X11 emulator is only helpful if it includes
  developer's tools, like include files, xmkmf, and the X libraries.
