Version 1.0 written 1991 by Hagen Eck and Sepp Kueblbeck
========================================================
fast and reliable diagram generator for renormalizable
field theories (i.e. with 3- and 4-vertices only), but
suffered from several restrictions:
-- no counter term generation possible
-- no fermion number violating theories possible
-- only Lorentz formalism available

Further modifications and enhancements:
-- Nov 97: added X11 (`point-and-click') topology editor


Version 2.0 written in 1995 by Hagen Eck
========================================
introduces a completely new three-level concept of generation.
Fills the above mentioned gaps in FA 1.
Some extra points are:
-- the Graphics routines now live in a separate context so as
   to be reusable by other packages


current Version 2.2:
====================
-- completely overhauled: no new concepts, but most of the code was
   rewritten entirely.
-- known FA 2.1 bugs removed.
-- much faster: e.g. model initialization is faster roughly by a
   factor 3.
-- includes a point-and-click topology editor together with a
   sophisticated autoshaping algorithm.

For a list of changes between 2.1 and 2.2 see the manual.
