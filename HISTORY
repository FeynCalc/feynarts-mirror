Version 1.0 written 1991 by Hagen Eck and Sepp Kueblbeck
========================================================
Fast and reliable diagram generator for renormalizable
field theories (i.e. with 3- and 4-vertices only), but
suffered from several restrictions:
-- no counter-term generation possible,
-- no fermion-number-violating theories possible,
-- only Lorentz formalism available.

Further modifications and enhancements:
-- Nov 97: added X11 (`point-and-click') topology editor


Version 2.0 written in 1995 by Hagen Eck
========================================
Introduces a completely new three-level concept of generation.
Fills the above-mentioned gaps in FA 1.
Some extra points are:
-- the Graphics routines now live in a separate context so as
   to be reusable by other packages.


Version 2.2 written in 1998 by Thomas Hahn:
===========================================
-- Completely overhauled: no new concepts, but most of the code was
   rewritten entirely.
-- Known FA 2.1 bugs removed.
-- Much faster: e.g. model initialization is faster roughly by a
   factor 3.
-- Includes a point-and-click topology editor together with a
   sophisticated autoshaping algorithm.

For a list of changes between 2.1 and 2.2 see the manual.


Version 3 written in 2000 by Thomas Hahn:
=========================================
-- Reprogrammed topology editor in Java for greater portability.
-- Output of Paint now easier to process further (e.g. selection
   of diagrams), rendering is done with the standard Mathematica
   functions Show, Display, Export.
-- Completely new rendering engine for PostScript and TeX.
-- Topologies get canonically ordered (main advantage: no extra
   shapes need to be defined for counter-term tops).

Further modifications and enhancements:
-- Jun 01: Added MSSM and MSSMQCD model files (see hep-ph/0105349).
-- Sep 01: Added ModelMaker utility to generate Feynman rules
   from the Lagrangian and write them to a model file.
