# Description

This repository attempts to follow the changes in the FeynArts development using git. We hope that this repository can be useful for people who work
on software packages that rely on FeynArts for the generation of Feynman diagrams. One of such packages is FeynCalc.

If you want to use FeynArts for your reasearch activities, please do not clone this repository. Instead, download the latest version from the [official site](http://www.feynarts.de/). Please contact Thomas Hahn (hahn@feynarts.de) for all FeynArts related issues or questions.
